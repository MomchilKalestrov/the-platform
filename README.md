# About

This is a code learning platform. The idea for the website came when a CompSci teacher made a complaint that it was hard to visualize memory allocation. From there it quickly grew to a platform that will have currated lessons and an IDE with debugging capabilites, visualizing how variables and objects are stored in the stack/heap.

# How to run

You don't. JK you just need NPM. Install the dependencies and run the dev script:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

It should look something like this.

By default the site will be hosted on `localhost:300`

# Structure

`/lessons` - the lessons and stuff. Currently there are none since I'm lazy

`/code_editor`- the code editor

`/homepage` - guess what this one is

`/` - will redirect to `/homepage`

# Notes

This is my first Next.js project please ignore sh*t code :)

This junk is under GPLv3
